This is the official code release of paper [Inverse Rendering for Complex Indoor Scenes: Shape, Spatially-Varying Lighting and SVBRDF From a Single Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17K3RrWQ48gQynOhZHq1g5sQgjLjoMiPk/view). The original models are trained on an extension of SUNCG dataset. Due to the copy right issue, we are not able to release the those models. Instead, we rebuilt a new high-quality synthetic indoor scene dataset and trained our models on it. We will open source the new dataset in the near future. The geometry configurations of the new dataset are based on the ScanNet [1], which is a large-scale repository of 3D scans of real indoor scenes. In the video below, we show a side by side comparison of the rendered synthetic dataset and the ScanNet inputs.
