This is the official code release of paper [Inverse Rendering for Complex Indoor Scenes: Shape, Spatially-Varying Lighting and SVBRDF From a Single Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17K3RrWQ48gQynOhZHq1g5sQgjLjoMiPk/view). The original models are trained on an extension of SUNCG dataset. Due to the copy right issue, we are not able to release the those models. Instead, we rebuild a new synthetic dataset using some existing open source datasets. The geometry configuration of the new dataset is based on the ScanNet [1], which is a large-scale repository of 3D scans of real indoor scenes.
